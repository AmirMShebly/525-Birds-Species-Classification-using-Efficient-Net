# 525-Birds-Species-Classification-using-Efficient-Net
This repository implements a multi-class classification model for identifying bird species using transfer learning with the EfficientNetB0 architecture.

Overview:

Dataset: The model was trained on a large dataset containing images of 525 different bird species.
Architecture: EfficientNetB0, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network known for its efficiency and accuracy.
Transfer Learning: The pre-trained weights of EfficientNetB0 were leveraged to initialize the model, allowing for faster training and improved performance.
Fine-tuning: The final layers of the model were fine-tuned on the bird image dataset to adapt it to the specific classification task.
